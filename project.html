    Relationship between music and economic conditions. Key areas to look at, GDP, real wages, consumption then relate this to the music. Pretty difficult to acquire accurate data of teh charts throughout the years and genre and so on from one place, without paying for a subscription. Instead, I used a csv file someone had collated to see the charts throughout the years, then used the spotify API to gather more inforamtion on these songs. This then allowed for comparison between them and the key economic indicators.

<p>Feel like there amy be some issues regarding the spotify API, the quick start guide asks for login, to get around this I am considering creating a burner account which will be permanently logged in on my website, so that I have access to all teh inforamtion i need</p>
